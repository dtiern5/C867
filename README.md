This is my project for C867 at WGU.
The course info specifically says I can use this in a portfolio, so I see no harm in sharing it here.

The project scenario required migrating an existing student system to C++ with given function and class requirements.
main() in main.cpp demonstrates this functionality.
There is an attached PNG file of a successful run to the console.

This is the first programming project I have ever completed, as well as my first time using C++ and github. I'm sure the code could use a lot of work.
I added comments, some (very amateur) formatting, and some cout strings that were not required, but I feel improve readability by quite a bit.
If you notice anything that could be improved, please don't hesitate to make a branch. It would benefit both my programming abilities and my comfort level with github.
